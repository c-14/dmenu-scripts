dmenu-scripts - Miscellaneous bash scripts that use dmenu
---------------------------------------------------------

[1] - Synopsis
This repository contains wrapper scripts for everyday programs I
want to use in conjunction with dmenu.

[2] - Requirements
The requirements are script-specific. Usually, the name of the script
implies its requirement programs (e.g dmenu-udevil needs udevil).

Any special requirements are listed in the corresponding script
section in [6].

[3] - Download
Clone the repo with git:
 - git clone git://github.com/vehk/dmenu-scripts.git

Or use wget to download a single script:
 - wget https://github.com/vehk/dmenu-scripts/raw/master/{scriptname}

[4] - Usage
Run the script.
Get script-specific help by passing the '-h' flag to the script.

[5] - dmenu
http://tools.suckless.org/dmenu

In order to centralize your dmenu configuration, my scripts source
.dmenurc in $HOME.
The configuration file contains the DMENU variable that specifies
which parameters dmenu is run with. Here is an example:
DMENU="dmenu -i -fn -*-terminus-medium-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-* -nb #3F3F3F -nf #DCDCCC -sb #1E2320 -sf #F0DFAF"

[6] - Scripts

[6.1] - dmenu-udevil
This script uses udevil in order to mount external devices without
root access. The default behaviour is to mount devices by label
found in /dev/disk/by-label/.

By passing the '-d' flag, you can instead mount devices found in /dev.
Here, the script tries to find all SATA/IDE devices (s[dr]* or hd*) in
order to cut down the length of arguments passed to dmenu and to
remove nonsensical devices (such as /dev/null).
Pass the '-i' flag to instead list all devices in /dev.

These scripts are considered public domain. Do whatever you want with
them.
